# TaskBookly v0.3.0-beta is here!
It's that time again! We're excited to announce the release of v0.3.0-beta. This is a large update, so let's not waste any times!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-check-double"></i>To-do Lists
This update introduces the brand new tasklist and the To-do tab, you can now track all your tasks from your classes and assign deadlines and priorities along with links to those tasks! Tasks can be sorted alphabatically and by deadline. Your tasks are also saved to your TaskBookly account, so you can access them from any device, anywhere, at any time!

**<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info iCustom"></i> 
TIP:** Use filter tags such as `[done]`, `[incomplete]`, or `[external]` in the search bar to filter down tasks based on tags provided!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i>Class Schedule
This update also introduces the class schedule! You can add up to 10 classes to your schedule and they will display when selecting a class for a task and in the TaskBookly Planner that's coming later this year.
You can find this feature under `Settings > Account > Class Schedule > Edit`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-stopwatch"></i>Pomodoro timer updates
You can now start a pomodoro timer from a specific period! The old navigation system has also been reworked so the delete button is no longer within the edit menu but instead in a new dropdown menu.

It's also now possible to assign a task from your to-do list to organize what you need to accomplish and split up your work periods into seperate 'segments.'

### <i class="fa-solid fa-plug-circle-bolt"></i>New Google API (BETA)
This update also introduces a new Google API integration that allows you to connect your Google account to your TaskBookly account. Doing this will mirror your Google Classroom assignments from classroom onto your TaskBookly To-do list so you can see everything in one place without having to manually create them.

Please note this is still a work in progress feature and bugs may be present. Your classroom data is not saved on our servers and is loaded along with your tasks from Google's servers.

To try out this feature navigate to `Settings > Connections > Google`. You will be prompted to login to your Google account and grant TaskBookly access to your Google Classroom data. Once you have done this, you can navigate to `To-do` and see your Google Classroom assignments. Google classroom tasks will be marked with a <i class="fa-solid fa-plug iCustom"></i> on the right side of the task.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-trash"></i>Account termination
It is now possible to delete your account from the settings page. This will delete all of your data from our servers and you will no longer be able to access your account. This is a permanent action and cannot be undone (obviously). We hope you don't do this though D:
